# Public talks by Hotels.com Technology
In this repo you can find presentations given by
[Hotels.com Technology](https://medium.com/hotels-com-technology) (part of Expedia Group) at conferences,
meetups, tech events, and more. When available links to recordings are
provided.

Having a list of our presentations on GitHub has the following benefits:
- There's a single place where people can find our presentations, and
  even helps us keep track of our external talks.
- It makes it easier for people to get an idea of the areas we're
  working on or are interested in. Of course, this doesn't mean that
  these are the only areas Hotels.com Technology has an interest in.
